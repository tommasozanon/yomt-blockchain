# yomt-blockchain

I'm experimenting with some things I'm currently learning.
First time using Rust. I'm a beginner who learns by doing.

Inspired by [Solana Whitepaper](https://github.com/solana-labs/whitepaper/blob/master/solana-whitepaper-en.pdf)

## Usage

### Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

### Build from source

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
./yomt-blockchain
```

### Create and look at documentation

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

I'm open to all kind of suggestions :)
