# yomt-blockchain

I'm experimenting with some things I'm currently learning.
First time using Rust. I'm a beginner who learns by doing.

Inspired by [Solana Whitepaper](https://github.com/solana-labs/whitepaper/blob/master/solana-whitepaper-en.pdf)

## Usage
### Install rustc, cargo and rustfmt.
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup component add rustfmt
```

### Build from source
```
cargo build --release
```

### Run
```
./yomt-blockchain
```

I'm open to all kind of suggestions :)
